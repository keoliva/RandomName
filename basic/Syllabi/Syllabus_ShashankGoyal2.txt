Two-Week Course

Course Objective:
	There are times when the world calls us to act, but we are not aware enough to hear it. My experiences at Carnegie Mellon have led me to believe that when our ‘heart is in the work’ we may not look up at the world moving around us. Is this a problem?

	15-237 is designed to ask these thought-provoking questions in the context of programming and social good. When do we ‘save the world’? How and can we do ‘small things with great love’? Is that our job?
